We know our stuff. We don't need flashy language - just calm expertise, delivered with heart.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Pillars

- **Clear**: We translate insurance into plain English.
- **Reassuring**: We make people feel calm and supported.
- **Human**: Warm, friendly, people first.
- **Helpful**: We always aim to be useful, not promotional.

### How We Sound

#### Do:
- "Here's what that means for your team…"
- "Let's keep it simple."
- "We'll walk you through the options."
- "Every business is different - here's what might suit yours."

#### Don't:
- "We deliver end-to-end wellbeing solutions." *(not accurate yet)*
- "Unlock your organisation's holistic wellbeing ecosystem." *(too corporate/abstract)*
- "Refer to Schedule 4 of your policy documentation…" *(too technical)*
