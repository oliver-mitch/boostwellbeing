COPY THIS PROMPT TO CLAUDE CODE WEB TO COMPLETE PLANSELECTOR INTEGRATION
===============================================================================

I need to complete the planSelector integration for the BoostWellbeing website.

CONTEXT:
- The planSelector is a React health insurance plan selector tool
- It's located in ../planSelector directory (already cloned)
- Foundation is set up: authentication, protected routes, rate data copied
- I need to migrate the React components to the Next.js portal

TASK:
Follow the implementation plan in TODO_PLANSELECTOR.md and
PLANSELECTOR_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md.

START WITH:
Phase 1: Component Migration
- Task 1.1: Create type definitions at src/types/portal.ts
- Task 1.2: Migrate PlanSelector component
- Task 1.3: Migrate FamilyMembers component
- Task 1.4: Migrate CostSummary component
- Task 1.5: Create main plan selector page

REQUIREMENTS:
- All components need 'use client' directive (Next.js requirement)
- Update all imports to use @/ paths (not ../ paths)
- Import from @/data/rateData (already exists)
- Test each component after migration
- Keep the same functionality as the original React app

FILES TO MIGRATE:
Source: ../planSelector/src/components/
Target: src/components/portal/

After completing Phase 1, move to Phase 2 (Supabase) or Phase 3 (Auth)
depending on priorities.

Check TODO_PLANSELECTOR.md for the complete checklist and mark items as you
complete them.

Ask me if you need clarification on any requirements or encounter issues.
