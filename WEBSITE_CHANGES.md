## Content & Copy: Sharpen for Decision-Makers

Your audience is likely HR leaders, business owners, CFOs, and MDs. They're time-poor and outcome-focused.

### "Why Southern Cross for Your Business"

This section is strong, but reads as if written by Southern Cross (which is probably accurate).

- **Add a short intro sentence from your voice:** "As a Southern Cross authorised partner, we recommend them because…"

### "The Business Case"

This is good, but you can make it more buyer-oriented by tying each benefit to a tangible business metric:

- **"Cut waiting times in half"** → link explicitly to reduced sick leave / faster project delivery.
- **"Win the war for talent"** → mention cost to replace staff, recruitment spend.
- **"Control costs, maximise value"** → emphasise predictability and long-term sustainability.

#### Example Tweak:

**Cut Waiting Times in Half**

Employees with health insurance spend less than half the time on waiting lists for elective surgery. That's fewer projects derailed, less firefighting for managers, and more predictable resourcing.

### "Case Studies"

The case study summaries are strong but generic – they all attribute impact to "Southern Cross", not to the way the scheme was designed/implemented.

If you can, subtly bring in your role:

*With support from BoostWellbeing and Southern Cross, ORIX NZ designed a scheme that…*

- 90 staff across four offices
- Introduced group health insurance as part of a broader wellbeing strategy
- **Result:** improved engagement scores, lower voluntary turnover, better EVP story in recruitment

### Resources & Insights

You're linking to Southern Cross articles which is an easy thought-leadership borrow. Consider owning the framing more clearly, e.g.:

*"We use Southern Cross Healthy Futures research to help you make evidence-based wellbeing decisions."*

If you want more leads, think about adding in your own article e.g. **"Download our 2-page executive summary: 'What NZ employees really want from wellbeing benefits' (email capture)."**

## Bios

### Oliver Mitch — Co-Founder, BoostWellbeing

Oliver brings over 25 years of experience in sales, property and business development, but what people notice most is how easy he is to talk to. He has a knack for understanding what a business needs and explaining things in a way that actually makes sense.

After a long, high-paced career, Oliver stepped back to refocus on health, family and what matters most. That time shaped his view of why good workplace benefits, especially access to health care, make such a meaningful difference.

At BoostWellbeing, Oliver's role is simple: make it easy for businesses to bring Southern Cross health insurance into their workplace. He takes a friendly, no-pressure approach, helping leaders understand their options and choose a plan that fits their people and their budget.

### Ashley Griffiths — Co-Founder, BoostWellbeing

Ashley has spent more than 20 years in the insurance industry, helping Kiwi businesses choose the right health, protection and employee benefit solutions. He's known for being relaxed, genuine and great at breaking down the technical stuff so anyone can feel confident in their decisions.

He takes the time to get to know each business - how big they are, how their teams work, and what they're trying to achieve - and then guides them through the Southern Cross workplace health insurance options that will support their people best.

At BoostWellbeing, Ashley keeps things straightforward: clear advice, practical choices, and support that feels personal, not transactional.
